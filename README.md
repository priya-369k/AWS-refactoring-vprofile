# AWS-refactoring-vprofile
A comprehensive AWS cloud migration project demonstrating **re-architecture/refactoring** strategy by migrating a traditional multi-tier web application (VProfile) from infrastructure-based deployment to AWS managed services (PaaS/SaaS). This project showcases modern cloud-native architecture, DevOps best practices, and infrastructure automation.

### **Migration Strategy**: Refactoring (Re-architecture)
**Goal**: Transform traditional infrastructure workloads into cloud-native AWS managed services for improved agility, scalability, and reduced operational overhead.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### **Before (Traditional Infrastructure)**
- Application servers on VMs/EC2
- Manual load balancer configuration
- Self-managed MySQL database
- Memcached on EC2
- RabbitMQ on EC2
- High operational overhead

### **After (AWS Managed Services)**
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** - PaaS for application deployment
- **Amazon RDS** - Managed MySQL database
- **Amazon ElastiCache** - Managed Memcached caching
- **Amazon MQ** - Managed RabbitMQ message broker
- **Amazon CloudFront** - CDN for global content delivery
- **Amazon Route 53** - DNS management
- **Application Load Balancer** - Automatic traffic distribution
- **Auto Scaling Groups** - Dynamic capacity management
